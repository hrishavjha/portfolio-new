            Since beginning my journey as a web developer nearly 7 years ago,
            Iâ€™ve done remote work for startups, and collaborated with talented
            people to create web products for both business and consumer use.

          <Paragraph dark className="mt-2">
            I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use,
            and built with best practices. The main area of my expertise is
            front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web
            apps, animations, and coding interactive layouts.
